/* 
In the DOM hierarchy, parent and children relationships are 
defined in relation to the position of the root node.

These relationships follow the nesting structure present in 
HTML code. Elements nested within one HTML tag are children 
of that parent element.

Each DOM element node has a .parentNode and .children property. 
The property will return a list of the elementâ€™s children and 
return null if the element has no children.

The .firstChild property will grant access to the first child 
of that parent element.
