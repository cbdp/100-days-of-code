 <!-- HTML4 introduced the defer and async attributes of the 
 <script> element to address the user wait-time in the 
   website based on different scenarios.

The defer attribute specifies scripts should be executed 
after the HTML file is completely parsed. When the HTML 
parser encounters a <script> element with the defer 
attribute, it loads the script but defers the actual 
execution of the JavaScript until after it finishes parsing 
the rest of the elements in the HTML file.

When is defer useful?
When a script contains functionality that requires 
interaction with the DOM, the defer attribute is the way to 
go. This way, it ensures that the entire HTML file has been 
parsed before the script is executed. -->
