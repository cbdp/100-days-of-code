 <!-- The async attribute loads and executes the script 
asynchronously with the rest of the webpage. This means 
that, similar to the defer attribute, the HTML parser will 
continue parsing the rest of the HTML as the script is 
downloaded in the background. However, with the async 
attribute, the script will not wait until the entire page is 
parsed: it will execute immediately after it has been 
downloaded.

When is it useful?
async is useful for scripts that are independent of other 
scripts in order to function accordingly. Thus, if it does 
not matter exactly at which point the script file is 
executed, asynchronous loading is the most suitable option as 
it optimizes web page load time. -->
