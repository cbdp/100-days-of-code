/* When writing a JSX expression that is on multiple 
lines it needs to be wrapped in parentheses. In the 
code block example we see this rule in action. The 
code block begins with a constant. Since the JSX 
expression has multiple lines after the constant we 
see the opening parentheses and at the end of the 
JSX expression we see the closing parentheses. */
