/* When viewing the code of a JSX element you may wonder 
if it is HTML or Javascript. JSX is an extension for 
Javascript and allows us to put HTML into JavaScript. 
In order for the code to compile the JSX expression must 
have exactly one outermost element. In the below block of 
code the tags are the outermost elements. */
