# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 7, 2020
##### IDE Setup

**Today's Progress**: Working on a new laptop, so spent time setting up my IDE. Battled npm, picked Adobe Brackets and tried to help out others on github.

**Notes**: First things first, working on translating a PWA (in gatsbyJS) to two different languages, then setting them all up to run independent of each other. When that's done I'll get back to my main goal of diving deeper into js, probably using codewars and a personal project.
